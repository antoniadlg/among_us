# among-us

## For Labor Day weekend my friends and I decided to play real life among us ( https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/ ), so this repository provides code for randomizing tasks for a round to play in real life. The provided csv file is an example of the type of tasks that can be used, as well as their assigned task number. If you would like to use this script make sure your task df or csv has the same format as the one in the repo.
